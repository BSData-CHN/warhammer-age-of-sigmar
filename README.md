## Important ##

**The Battlescribe data editor can cause problems when merging updates. Because of this, and also to avoid duplicated 
effort where multiple people are working on the same files, please join us on Discord before you commit changes to the files.**

**UPDATE AoS 3.0:**
The Catalogs have been updated to support Matched Play points and FAQ's for AoS v3.0 release. 
The **\***Pitched Battle***\** Profile supports matched play and includes the new Core Battalions.
The new **\***Narrative Battle***\** Profile supports play with warscroll Battalions.  This is where you'll find all the previous
edition Battalion warscrolls.

The changes for AoS 3.0 are significant and undoubtedly some things are broken, missing or just plain wrong.  Please file a bug
for errors, omissions per the bug reporting documented below.
