## Important ##

**The Battlescribe data editor can cause problems when merging updates. Because of this, and also to avoid duplicated 
effort where multiple people are working on the same files, please join us on Discord before you commit changes to the files.**

**UPDATE AoS 3.2:**
The Catalogs have been updated to support Matched Play points and FAQ's for the General's Handbook
Pitched Battles 2022-23 - Season 2.  Previous edition General's Handbook rules continue to be supported.
